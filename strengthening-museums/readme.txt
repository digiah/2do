This project envisions, for the first time, the development of comprehensive visitor surveys that can be used by Hawaiian cultural institutions throughout the state. Facilitated by the UH Museum Studies Graduate Certificate Program (MSGCP), a leader in visitor studies would collaboratively develop surveys in consultation with representatives from 'Iolani Palace, Queen Emma Summer Palace, Hulihee Palace and the Hawaii Museums Association. Museum staff and students would receive professional training and administer the surveys at each partner site. MSGCP and students would collate the data and post the results on a restricted website available only to the participating museums, along with the visitor studies resource materials. For the first time, consistent information would e gathered across the board. the results, which would be shared with HTA, would document the significance of Native Hawaiian cultural experiences and quantify the extent to which the Hawaiian culture impacts our visitors, both locally and beyond.
