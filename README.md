# 2do
the working to do list
Make new items and assign them a "2do" label and an assignee(s).  Discuss issue as needed in issues section.  any longterm knowledge goes in the wiki.  Wiki should probably have listing of projects, but I am not sure if it is project specific or specific to the team.  Right now, it does have an [explanation of how we use](https://github.com/digiah/2do/wiki/GIT).
