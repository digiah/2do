1.  for initial time only.  go in the directory where you want to create the local repository to make changes and type "git clone" and the URL or the repository, which can find on the github page for the repo in the lower right corner.  After the initial clone, bring the repo up to date before making new changes by issuing a "git pull" from within the repository's directory.
2. cd to the directory of the cloned repo. make changes and add as needed.  when finished, go to the top directory of the repo (NOT the topmost Git directory, but the one where the files for the particular repo are) and type "git add", then "git commit" (you will neeed to type a description of the changes in a text file that comes up and then save the file) then "git push" entering credentials as needed.
